Operations allowed:
---------
1. Next() method-checks for the next element to the cursor and moves the cursor to next element in the list.
2. Add(x) method-adds a specific element before the element that will be returned by a call to next() method. 
3. Prev() method-checks for a previous element to the cursor and moves the cursor to it.
4. Remove() method-removes the element pointer by the cursor and moves the cursor to the previous element.

The above are the methods to work around with the Doubly Linked List.
