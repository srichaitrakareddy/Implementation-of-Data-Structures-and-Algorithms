About: 
Short Project 4 - Implementation of Binary search trees

Operations involved: 

- 1 add(x): Adds x to tree. If tree contains a node with same key, replaces the element by x. 
	    Returns true if x is a new element added to tree

- 2 remove(x): Removes x from tree. Returns x if found, otherwise returns null
	

- 3 get(x): Checks if there is an element that is equal to x in the tree and element in tree that is equal to x is returned, null otherwise.
- 4 find(x): Checks if x is present in the tree and returns 
the node,Otherwise returns the node at which the search fails	

- 5 contains(x): boolean method that searches for an element equal to x in the tree and returns true if found, otherwise returns false
- 6 min(): returns the minimum element in the tree
- 7 max(): returns the maximum element in the tree
- 8 toArray(): returns an array with the elements of the tree arranged using inorder traversal
